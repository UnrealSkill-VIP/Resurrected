# Resurrected
Dirrrrty, yet powerful, Counter Strike Global Offensive external hack (Created 2016.06.04)

Aimbot, ESP, Glow, Recoil Control with menu and config system (json) in place

pretty much all the shenanigans you need.
might require some or heavy updating, its been a loooong time since it was running.
there is a null access violation somewhere that may require a copy of a list instead of a reference but it works and does not affect the hacks performance.

update the offsets yourself.

im sorry hurricane
